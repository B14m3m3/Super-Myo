# Super-Myo
A Pong-like game made by Arnar Thordur Hardarson and Christian Koller Nielsen for the MLH event in Aarhus called AUHack.
The executeable itself is not very exciting as it requires 2 Myo's to play the game.

Though the source for the game is downloadable and can be opened in the Unity3d game engine. To play with a keyboard you can tick "test" on for the players and gameController objects.

(Keyboard)With test enabled: Playable with W/S/D for up/down/shoot, likewise for player 2 up/down/left-arrows.

(2 Myo's)Without test enabled: Playable with "move hand up"/"move hand down"/"make a fist" to move up/down/shoot. To recalibrate the Myo's level your hand and press the R Key and to invert up/down press E for player 1 or Left arrow for player 2

This game won the facepalm price for the AUHACK event and was also nominated for the best project award.

There will most likely be bugs in the game, as it was made in less than 24 hours, and it was a new experience playing around with Myo's and Unity3d game engine.
