# Super-Myo
A Pong-like game made by Arnar Thordur Hardarson and Christian Koller Nielsen for the MLH event in Aarhus called MLH
The executeable itself is not very exciting as it requires 2 Myo's to play the game.

Thought the game is downloadable as the source and opened in the Unity3d game engine, where u can tick "test" on for the players and gameController objects

After that it is playable with W/S/D for up/down/shoot, likewise for player 2 up/down/left

With Myo's the game is played with "move hand up"/"move hand down"/"make a fist" to move up/down/shoot

This game won the facepalm price for the AUHACK event and was also nominated for the best project award
